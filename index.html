    <h2 id="journey">Beginning My Coding Journey</h2>
    <h6>Posted on November 14th, 2023</h6>

    <p>
      For the past few weeks, I have been throwing myself into coding. My
      current situation implores me to learn quickly and swiftly in order to
      find a well-paying job within a relative short amount of time. This is
      where I thought of coding as not only is it something that I have always
      wanted to learn, but a job that is always looking for more people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish I had more time to slowly make my way through the courses and
      really delve into the methodology and practices of web-development, but
      alas I must move like a flowing river if I am to maintain good standing
      within society. However, I will do what I can to enjoy the journey that I
      am on!
    </p>

    <h2 id="method">My Practice Method</h2>
    <h6>Posted on November 15th, 2023</h6>
    <p>
      My current method of practicing a lot more coding is by utilizing both
      <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/"><em>KhanAcademy</em></a> and
      <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/"><em>FreeCodeCamp</em></a>
      while going through the course. I feel that while both websites are great
      at teaching, there are parts that I feel that one does better than the
      other and vice-versa, which made me decide that both would be necessary to
      make swift progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>KhanAcademy</em> excells at easy-to-learn lessons and digestable
      bite-sized courses that make it easy to start, regardless of your lack of
      coding knowledge. This makes it a great place to gather information and
      enhance your knowledge of the fundamentals of coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is in stark contract to <em>FreeCodeCamp</em> which I personally feel
      has a less hand-holding method of teaching. This can sometimes lead to
      obtuse requests without any explanation of the metholodgy being used, thus
      leading to confusion. However, the adundance of lessons and constant push
      to help you gain more in-depth knowledge is outstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the reason that I feel that both combined is
      <strong>THE WAY</strong> to learn coding as a beginner. With both really
      adding to the experience and helping with retaining information.
